    <p>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp and I enjoy solving problems with code. In the past year, I have developed my skills with Solomon Cloud Solutions as an intern. I have developed various third party applications such as the Audit Utility and the Employee Group Assignment Utility. Aside from developing, I have spent even more time working as a support team member for their customers. Helping indviduals with anything from SAP Crystal Report debugging, transaction importing and many more issues with Microsoft Dynamics SL. </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp At Bowling Green State University, I am currently working on a senior project known as Scramble Keeper. This web application will be the footprint of a future mobile app that keeps scores for a golf scramble event. The website offers basic user authentication, event creation, score keeping, team forming and many more features.

      &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp In my spare time I have been working on this website of course! This current page will be this short bio as well as a blog of my current endeavors in coding and the industry itself. The <a href="/views/projects">Current Projects</a> section, are short blurbs as well as demos of some of my projects. That leaves the <a href="/views/playground">Playground</a> which highlights some of my smaller projects and experiments.

      <p>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Currently my website is a work in progress and a side project to work and school. Between all of the chaos, I'm probably working on this to some degree. This week I got everything in place as far as basic views that actually show something. </p> <p>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Ultimately I would like everything to be somewhat in place by my first iteration. After that, I want to explore transferring these articles, posts, etc. into something like Parse or Firebase. </p>
